# 2020 Election Model

A very simple Bayesian Election Model for the 2020 Elections. Currently it is capable of predicting the vote share of the Democrats and Republicans using national poll data.

A detailed description of the model and the theory behind it is available on my blog here.

In the diagram above the performance of the model on the vote share of the 2008 presidential election is illustrated over time. Each dot represent polls taken over the period preceding the election and the solid line illustrates the mean of the posterior distribution. On the final day of polling () the model stated that there was approximately a 64% chance that Obama would win the popular vote.
